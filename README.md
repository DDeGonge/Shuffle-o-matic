All part numbers in the pcb should be accurate, though again review and order at your own risk. Use KiCad to view/edit, it's free!

And probably a few other things I'm forgetting. Seriously if you want to make this, do so at your own risk. Review the cad model yourself and make sure you have everything accounted for! This is not a project for beginners!
